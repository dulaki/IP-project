    <h1>100 Best Songs of 2025</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      Your favorite songs of the year defied genre and redefined them. They saw through the eyes of cannibals and made
      their peace with being the bad guy. They played word games and saw trouble over the horizon. They played with
      pedalboards and then set them aside for the sake of the lyrics, turned up the BPMs and added an even better
      bassline. They captured something pure and then got a little raunchy, and then said goodbye to it all. And most
      important of all, they got us through the year.
